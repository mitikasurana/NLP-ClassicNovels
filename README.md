# NLP-ClassicNovels

What are the most frequent words in Herman Melville's novel, Moby Dick, and how often do they occur?

 - In this notebook, I have scraped the novel Moby Dick from the website Project Gutenberg (which contains a large corpus of books) using the Python package requests. 
 - Then extracted words from this web data using BeautifulSoup. 
 - Finally,dived into analyzing the distribution of words using the Natural Language ToolKit (nltk) and Counter.

The Data Science pipeline built in this notebook can be used to visualize the word frequency distributions of any novel that you can find on Project Gutenberg. The natural language processing tools used here apply to much of the data that data scientists encounter as a vast proportion of the world's data is unstructured data and includes a great deal of text.
